% Ivan Dimitrov's Resume
%
% Preferred Structure:
% - Work experience: current company and title.
% - Languages and technologies that you are proficient with.
% - Education details: these become less relevant over time. With a few years’ experience, they can still be good indicators. After multiple jobs or decades, consider moving this lower down.
% - Extracurricular things like patents, publications, talks, and standout open source contributions.
% - Certifications. This one is interesting. Companies hiring for generalists don’t usually care, especially if it’s not an industry-wide recognized certification. Agencies and more “traditional” companies could give it some weight, though.
% - Personal projects. The more experience you have, the less important these become. Standout contributions, especially to popular projects, could be an exception. Still, they rarely weigh more than your work experience.
% - Interests: these can be a starting point for the conversation on an onsite interview, and they make your resume more personal.
